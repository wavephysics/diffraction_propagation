# diffraction_propagation

Please find more details below about the repo.


## Introduction to the repo

The following repo is used to simulate the physics of **diffraction** and the **propagation** of a light beam after its diffraction on certain **geometry** (circular aperture, triangle, polygone, Even a text aperture ...)

We make use to create this simulation, **Fresnel diffraction integral**, **Angular Spectrum method**, **Direct integration** and **Beam Propagation Method**.

# Dependencies

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- PIL (pillow) (I used this library to create different geometries of the aperture.
